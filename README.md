## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Working through this project helped me to practice my HTML and CSS skills that  i learned after watching a couple of web development tutorials as well as reading books. 

This project also helped me in develping skills  to build/develop a website from a design. And am so glad that after all the strugle of getting  styles like `font-size`, `padding`, `margin` `etc`, from the design by just looking through the designs, i managed to  build and complete this single price grid component challenge  which is just as close as to the the designs provided in this challenge.

<p>Coding is fun :)</p>

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://www.csstricks.io) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand css grid property. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [W3Schools](www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.html) - This helped me to understand media queries especially how the  `min-width` and `max-width` works in media queries. This in turn helped me to manage the mobile-first workflow process indicated in - [My process](#my-process) section above.
